 hey ponytown people this is all u need to know about me:

my main interest right now is enstars so that's mostly the area i might be at (i'm mainly an UNDEADP and EdenP) i'm in a lot of other fandoms too (mostly anime and music) feel free to int and we can talk about stuff!! i like meeting new people but only IF YOU'RE CHILL

ALSO PLEASE DON'T INT WITH ME IF YOU'RE -18 EXCEPT IF YOU'RE MY SIBLING OR MUTAL FROM THEM

one last thing to mention is that i actually think this game sucks and i hate it but idk what happened to all the otehr fun games damn it
